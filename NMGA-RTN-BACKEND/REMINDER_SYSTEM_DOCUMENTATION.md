# NMGA Reminder System Documentation

## Overview

The NMGA Reminder System is a comprehensive automated notification system that keeps distributors and members informed about important deadlines and opportunities in the deal commitment process. The system operates on a **monthly schedule basis** using cron jobs and sends both email and SMS notifications.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Scheduler** (`utils/scheduler.js`) - Manages all automated tasks
2. **Monthly Schedule** (`utils/monthlySchedule.js`) - Central schedule logic matching CreateDeal.jsx
3. **Distributor Reminders** (`utils/distributorReminders.js`) - Handles distributor notifications
4. **Member Reminders** (`utils/memberCommitmentReminders.js`) - Handles member notifications
5. **Email Templates** - Professional HTML email templates with monthly context
6. **SMS Templates** - Concise mobile-friendly messages with monthly context
7. **Database Tracking** - Prevents duplicate notifications per month

### Scheduling

All reminders run on **New Mexico Mountain Time** (America/Denver timezone):

- **Daily at 9:00 AM**: Distributor reminder checks
- **Daily at 10:00 AM**: Member reminder checks  
- **Every minute**: Member 1-hour closing warnings (for testing)
- **Daily at 5:00 PM**: Daily commitment summaries

### Monthly Schedule Logic

The system uses a **centralized monthly schedule** that replicates the exact logic from `CreateDeal.jsx`:

- **Posting Deadline**: 3 days before each month starts
- **Commitment Window**: Specific dates for each month (varies by month)
- **Deal Period**: Full month duration
- **All dates are in New Mexico Mountain Time**

---

## Distributor Reminder System

### 1. Monthly Deal Posting Deadline Reminders

**Purpose**: Remind ALL distributors to post their deals for the upcoming month before the monthly posting deadline.

**When Sent**:
- 5 days before the monthly posting deadline
- 3 days before the monthly posting deadline  
- 1 day before the monthly posting deadline

**How It Works**:
1. **Checks the monthly schedule** to determine if today is 5, 3, or 1 days before the posting deadline
2. **Gets the next month's schedule** (e.g., if it's December 2024, checks January 2025 deadline)
3. **Sends reminders to ALL distributors** regardless of whether they have deals or not
4. **Prevents duplicates** by checking if the distributor was already notified for that month

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Today is 5, 3, or 1 days before the monthly posting deadline
- Distributor hasn't been notified for this specific month yet
- Distributor is active and not blocked

**Email Content**:
```html

## Monthly Schedule System

### Overview

The reminder system now operates on a **monthly schedule basis** instead of individual deal tracking. This ensures consistent timing and prevents confusion about deadlines.

### Monthly Schedule Logic (`utils/monthlySchedule.js`)

The system replicates the exact schedule logic from `CreateDeal.jsx`:

#### **Schedule Generation**
- **Generates a complete table** of all months with their specific deadlines and commitment periods
- **Handles special cases** for specific months (July 2025, August 2025, etc.)
- **Uses New Mexico Mountain Time** for all date calculations
- **Covers current year and next year** to handle year transitions

#### **Key Functions**
1. **`generateDealMonthsTable()`** - Creates the complete monthly schedule
2. **`shouldSendPostingReminders()`** - Checks if posting reminders should be sent today
3. **`shouldSendCommitmentWindowOpeningReminders()`** - Checks if opening reminders should be sent today
4. **`shouldSendCommitmentWindowClosingReminders()`** - Checks if closing reminders should be sent today
5. **`getCurrentMonthSchedule()`** - Gets the current month's schedule
6. **`getNextMonthSchedule()`** - Gets the next month's schedule

#### **Monthly Schedule Example**
```javascript
{
  month: "January",
  year: 2025,
  deadline: "2024-12-29",           // 3 days before month starts
  timeframeStart: "2025-01-01",     // Deal period start
  timeframeEnd: "2025-01-31",       // Deal period end
  commitmentStart: "2024-12-29",    // Commitment window start
  commitmentEnd: "2025-01-09"       // Commitment window end
}
```

#### **Special Month Handling**
The system handles specific months with custom commitment periods:
- **July 2025**: June 29 - July 10
- **August 2025**: August 1 - August 12
- **September 2025**: September 1 - September 10
- **October 2025**: October 1 - October 11
- **November 2025**: November 1 - November 10
- **December 2025**: December 1 - December 10
- **January 2026**: December 29, 2025 - January 9, 2026
- And more...

#### **Default Schedule**
For months not specifically defined, the system uses:
- **Commitment Period**: First 10 days of the month
- **Posting Deadline**: 3 days before the month starts

### Benefits of Monthly Schedule System

1. **Consistency**: All reminders are based on the same monthly schedule
2. **Simplicity**: No need to track individual deal dates
3. **Accuracy**: Uses the exact same logic as the CreateDeal component
4. **Scalability**: Works regardless of how many deals are created
5. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for all scheduling logic

---

## Commitment Notification System

### When Commitments Are Approved/Declined

**Purpose**: Notify members when their commitments are approved or declined by distributors.

**Trigger**: When distributor updates commitment status via bulk actions or individual updates.

**Email Content**:
```html
Subject: Your Commitment for [Deal Name] has been [Approved/Declined]

Dear [Member Name],

Your commitment for the deal [Deal Name] has been updated.

Commitment Details:
‚Ä¢ Deal: [Deal Name]
‚Ä¢ Size Details: [Size breakdown if applicable]
‚Ä¢ Total Price: $[Amount]
‚Ä¢ Status: [Approved/Declined] by the distributor

[If Approved:]
Your commitment has been approved by the distributor. You will be contacted with further instructions regarding payment and delivery.

[If Declined:]
Unfortunately, your commitment has been declined by the distributor. Please check your dashboard for more information or contact the distributor directly if you have any questions.

Best regards,
The NMGA Team
```

## Database Tracking

### Log-Based Tracking (New System)

The new monthly-based system uses the `Logs` collection for tracking instead of the Deal model:

```javascript
// Log entry for distributor posting reminders
{
  message: "5-day posting reminder sent to ABC Distribution Co. for January 2025",
  type: "info",
  user_id: ObjectId("distributor_id"),
  createdAt: Date
}

// Log entry for member opening reminders
{
  message: "Commitment window opening reminder sent to Member Store 1 for January 2025",
  type: "info", 
  user_id: ObjectId("member_id"),
  createdAt: Date
}

// Log entry for member closing reminders
{
  message: "3 days commitment window closing reminder sent to Member Store 1 for January 2025 (has commitments)",
  type: "info",
  user_id: ObjectId("member_id"),
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Duplicate Prevention (Monthly-Based)

The system prevents duplicate notifications by:
1. **Checking Log entries** for existing reminders for the specific month and user
2. **Using regex patterns** to match reminder messages with month/year context
3. **Tracking per month** instead of per deal
4. **Unique keys** based on reminder type, month, year, and user

### Deal Model (Legacy - Still Present)

The `Deal` model still includes the original tracking structure for backward compatibility:

```javascript
// Distributor reminder tracking (legacy)
distributorReminders: {
  postingReminders: {
    type: Map,
    of: [{
      reminderType: { type: String, enum: ['5_days', '3_days', '1_day'] },
      sentAt: { type: Date }
    }],
    default: new Map()
  },
  approvalReminders: {
    type: Map,
    of: [{
      reminderType: { type: String, enum: ['5_days_after_commitment'] },
      sentAt: { type: Date }
    }],
    default: new Map()
  }
},

// Member reminder tracking (legacy)
memberReminders: {
  windowOpeningReminders: {
    type: Map,
    of: [{
      reminderType: { type: String, enum: ['1_day_before_opening'] },
      userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
      sentAt: { type: Date }
    }],
    default: new Map()
  },
  windowClosingReminders: {
    type: Map,
    of: [{
      reminderType: { type: String, enum: ['5_days_before_closing', '3_days_before_closing', '1_day_before_closing', '1_hour_before_closing'] },
      userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
      sentAt: { type: Date }
    }],
    default: new Map()
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Log-Based Tracking

1. **Simpler Queries**: Easy to search for existing reminders using regex patterns
2. **Better Audit Trail**: Complete history of all reminder activities
3. **Monthly Context**: Each log entry includes the specific month and year
4. **User-Specific**: Each log entry is tied to a specific user
5. **Searchable**: Easy to find and analyze reminder patterns
